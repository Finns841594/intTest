# Ubiquity Code Interview Project

This project was built for a code interview.
This repo is set to public for a limited time for Simon, Egils and their team to check my code.

## Project Guidence

Visit [here](https://threejs-ubi.vercel.app) for testing out deployed app.

For this app, you can:

### Add a product

By click the button of the sample product, you can add product to scene easily. Placable surfaces will be highligted before finsh placing.
I kept the size of product big for easier visulization.

### Move a product

Click a product in the scene to relocate it.

If camera is higher than ceiling, the ceiling will be hidden for better relocating.

### Delete a product

All products in the scene are list below the canvas. Hover on a card will highlight the corresponding product in the scene, and then click Delete button to remove it from the scene.

### Samples are in 3D

You can check the sample products by the top menu bar.
